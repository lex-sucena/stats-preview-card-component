## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I coded this project mostly to learn how to use CSS Grid to make responsive layouts.


### Continued development

In the future, I'll be focusing on building more complex responsive layouts with Grid and Flexbox. Also would like to improve my UX/UI design skills and build my own website interface.

### Useful resources

- [How to use CSS clamp() property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/clamp) - This helped me to understand how to use CSS clamp(), which I used to make my Grid container's width more fluid and responsive. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Complete Guide to CSS Grid](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand how to align Grid Items. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
